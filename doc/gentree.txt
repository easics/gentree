This plugin provides vim functionality for tree files. It contains the
following standard vim subdirectories with functionality for gentree:

                                                       *gentreeFtdetect*
ftdetect   Automatic filetype detection for tree files. This sets the
           filetype to tree.

                                                       *gentreeSyntax*
syntax     This provides syntax highlighting for gentree syntax.

                                                       *gentreeIndent*
indent     This defines indent rules for tree files.

ftplugin   This defines the characters used for documentation. Defining these
           characters as comments, allows vim to take some extra rules in
           account when using standard vim commands.
           E.g. when using <gq> to split a comment line, the resulting split
           starts each line with the comment characters.
